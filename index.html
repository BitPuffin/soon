        	<header>About</header>
        	<p>The Lonely Byte is a very small art producing company with a major focus on interactive experiences ("Games").</p>
        	<p>The goal is to produce meaningful experiences regardless if they appeal to everybody. I realize the fact that games has a way of immersing you in a way that no other medium can - and I want to explore that.</p>
        	<p>If The Lonely Byte becomes successful enough, I will start looking to publish and fund developers who share similar goals regarding games. Creations that change the way we think of games.</p>
        	<p>There are a lot of ideas and plans to where I want to go with this project/company, it is what I want to devote my life to. I hope I can reach out to you through my creations and give you something of value.</p>

        	<header>Projects</header>
        	<p>My first project will be announced very shortly.</p>
        	<p>It is currently in development and will be announced as soon as the project website is ready!</p>
